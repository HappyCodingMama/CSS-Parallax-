        A mountain is a large landform that rises above the surrounding land in
        a limited area, usually in the form of a peak. A mountain is generally
        considered to be steeper than a hill. Mountains are formed through
        tectonic forces or volcanism. These forces can locally raise the surface
        of the earth. Mountains erode slowly through the action of rivers,
        weather conditions, and glaciers. A few mountains are isolated summits,
        but most occur in huge mountain ranges. High elevations on mountains
        produce colder climates than at sea level. These colder climates
        strongly affect the ecosystems of mountains: different elevations have
        different plants and animals. Because of the less hospitable terrain and
        climate, mountains tend to be used less for agriculture and more for
        resource extraction and recreation, such as mountain climbing and
        skiing.
